## Usage

1. **Upload sitemap CSV**: Start by uploading a CSV export of your website's sitemap. At minimum, the CSV should include:
   - `Address` column with the full URLs
   - Ideally, include `Status Code` to filter out non-200 pages

2. **Configure URL patterns**: Select a website type template or customize URL patterns to identify:
   - Product/Detail Pages (PDPs)
   - Category/Listing Pages (PLPs)
   - Different levels of your site hierarchy

3. **Generate cross-linking plan**: Click the "Generate Cross-linking Plan" button to create recommendations based on the configured patterns and rules.

4. **Download and implement**: Download the complete cross-linking plan as a CSV and implement the links according to the suggested placements and priorities.

## CSV Format

Your input CSV should include at least the following columns:
- `Address`: Full URL of each page (required)
- `Status Code`: HTTP status code (recommended)
- `Content Type`: Type of content (optional)
- `Indexability`: Whether the page is indexable (optional)

## Example

An e-commerce site might have URL patterns like:
- PDPs: `product/[product-name]`
- Category PLPs: `category/[category-name]`
- Subcategory PLPs: `category/[category]/[subcategory]`

The app will identify these patterns and generate appropriate cross-links between them.

## Advanced Customization

You can customize:
- URL identification patterns using regular expressions
- Linking rules between different page types
- Maximum number of links to generate
- Anchor text and placement suggestion approaches
